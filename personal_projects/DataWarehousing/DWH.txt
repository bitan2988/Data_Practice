In this project we initially had 15 tables in the DB.

To convert it into a DWH we first will combine few tables into 1 as we can see that 
redundant data is present across many table and to extract it requires a lot of 
complex JOINS.

So we will make a Star-Schema from it.

Fact-Table:
    fact_sales : hold all sales data, PK of all other dimension_tables and sales_amount


So the Dimension tables we will have will be
    dim_date : for all date related queries
    dim_customer : we will basically merge all the customer adresses into one
    dim_store : to hold all store related data into one
    sim_film : merge film related data into one
